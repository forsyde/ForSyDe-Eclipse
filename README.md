# The ForSyDe-Eclipse Project
The ForSyDe-Eclipse project uses the model-driven engineering solutions provided
by the [Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](https://eclipse.org/modeling/emf/)
such as graphical modeling, model transformation and code generation to
implement and facilitate ForSyDe modeling and design flows.

The project consists of
- A ForSyDe Ecore meta-model based on ForSyDe's intermediate representation
(ForSyDe-IR)
- A graphical block diagram editor based on
[Sirius](https://eclipse.org/sirius/).
- Examples of Model-to-Model (M2M) transformations on ForSyDe models using
[ATL](https://eclipse.org/atl/).
- Generation of [ForSyDe-SystemC](https://github.com/shaniaki/ForSyDe-SystemC)
code from ForSyDe Ecore models using [Acceleo](http://www.eclipse.org/acceleo/).

Consult the project's [wiki pages](../../wiki) for tutorials on how to use the tools.
